                <h3><a id="side1" name="side1">1: Explain the concept of Responsive Design.<br />  
                    What does the term mean?  What did you discover in your research?</a> </h3>

                <p class="answer">
                    &emsp;Responsive design is a method of building a website that does not depend on the screen size of the device. 
                    In other words, it is a design that adjusts the size or/and the arrangement of the web page depending on the window width of the device and automatically switch to the easy-to-see display.<br /><br />  
                    &emsp;Responsive design is a great way to provide "easy-to-read and easy-to-use" web sites for an increasing number of mobile users. <br /> <br />
                    &emsp;In my research, I discovered that responsive design does not need to create separated PC and mobile sites.  
                    We only need to build one common website and prepare one type of URL or HTML for each page, because the design such as the display width is controlled by CSS rather than HTML.
                    Also, I discovered that responsive design  corresponds to "Mobile First Index" and "Mobile Friendly"<br /><br />
                    &emsp;The simplicity of this site structure is one of the characteristics of responsive design and is a factor that brings many benefits. 
                    <br /><br />
                </p>



                <h3><a id="side2" name="side2">2: How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</a><br /> 
                    How can web pages take advantage of it? </h3>

                <p class="answer">
                    <ul  class="answer">
                        <li>Especially for a small screen such as a smartphone, it improves ease of viewing and ease of use.</li><br />
                        <li>One URL makes it easy for users to link and share. For instance, if there is a mobile site for smartphone and pc site for personal computers, you must send a different URL to match the device of the user you want to show.
                        </li><br />
                        <li>It corresponds to "Mobile First Index" and "Mobile Friendly", so it will be displayed at the top of the search results.</li><br />
                        <li>Because URL, HTML, and CSS are one source, it is easy to update and maintain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>



                <h3><a id="side3" name="side3">3: What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive design?</a> </h3>
                
                <p class="answer">
                    I used liquid layouts.
                    This technique uses percentages to specify the width. Also, I used min-width and max-width to keep element's min or max size to keep user's view clear and easy-to-see.<br /></p>


                <h3><a id="side4" name="side4">4: What did you learn about building web apps for different devices? </a></h3>
               
                <p class="answer">
                    I've learned that the responsive design is very important concept in web develop technology. <br />
                    With smartphones becoming more popular and the use of SNS flourishing, creating a website considering the easy-to-see design and ease of sharing them will greatly affect the customers' businesses.<br /> 
                    I would like to learn more about efficient web design (including advanced responsive design )so that I can create customer’s websites more productive.
                    <br /></p>
